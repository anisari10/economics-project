Research project on inequality indices

A research project in a team of three. We analysed contradictions observed in indices like GDI, GII, GGGI
for different regions and found the possible reasons for the anomalies. We also attempted to answer the
need of multiple indices to depict the inequality of a country. In-depth analysis for the Sub-Saharan
countries was done using trend-analysis - this involved handling large data. Data analysis was done
primarily using Excel and partly using Pandas.
